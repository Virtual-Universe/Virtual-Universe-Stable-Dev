Virtual-Universe-Stable-Dev is the stable development stage repository of Virtual Universe Open Source Project Arm.  Code arrives in this repository for final testing and debugging prior to it moving to the stable release repository.  When something is committed to this repository it does not mean it is final and there is no guarantee it will make it to a stable release right away if at all.  Likewise the code in this repository is not considered stable yet and only the faint of heart should use this code for testing purposes only.  Please do not use this repository to run a production level grid.
